TF2 DDS Fly Converter

Made by StormShockMods

Hello everyone, welcome to the readme for the Fly Converter. Since most model swap mods
require DDS (Direct Draw Surface) Files for making rpaks, and the conversions are standardized for each image type, I 
decided to make a quick program to easily allow any mod maker to convert their png or jpg files to the
correct compression method of DDS file for their rpaks. I named it the Fly Converter because it makes the process of converting to DDS fly by!

Once you have sorted your files into the image types below:

_col
_spc
_ao
_cav
_ilm
_gls
_nml

and named them with those suffixes, just drag and drop each file into the appropriate slot,
and hit Go to convert them all to DDS files. The program will keep the original jpg or png files
and will put the converted files into an Output folder inside the same folder as the images (not sure if it will make an output folder for each image
if they're in different folders, so make sure all your textures you want to convert are in the same folder before you start).

Then you can easily move the converted files into your rPak assets folder to convert!

Happy modding!
